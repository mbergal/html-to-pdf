        <h5>What I want</h5>
        <p>
            I want to contribute to building high value software in a smart, passionate, caring team. It would be really
            cool to actually work on something that improves the world in education or healthcare.
        </p>

        <p>As a software engineer I value UX design, simplicity (as in
            <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple-Made-Easy</a>),
            maintainability, <b>absence of fear</b> (static typing, automatic tests) and working as a team.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a team member/team lead I value shared vision, aligned goals, care and empathy towards mission, results
            and people.
        </p>
        <p>I believe that inspired people are way more productive than just engaged ones. I also believe that culture is
            super important and <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerful-Building-Culture-Freedom-Responsibility-ebook/dp/B077Y4WVPT">Netflix
                got many things right</a>, although not every company can afford to do what they do.
        </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                We developed a web tool to help teachers engage students, especially in the challenging environments
                with
                large class sizes
                so everybody could be heard and be safe. We consistently pushed out new features while keeping system up
                and running and bringing in new developers. Our team (Joel, Cassie, Asma and me) did the full cycle of
                product development - from UX
                design to implementation to ongoing support, cool stuff for like Flashcard Factory
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afmp1zqPyQI (this video is by our user, not us!)
            </p>
            <p>
                We were able to do that by working in small vertical teams, constantly aligning, and having a shared
                vision
                on what product,
                code and process should be. We never left anybody alone with problem, situation or task. As one of two
                most-experienced
                devs, I put steady efforts into gradually improving product architecture, code quality, system
                maintainabilty,
                and most importantly creating a shared vision on where we are going technically as a development team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implemented collection of microservices running on GKE/AppEngine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Provided product/UX design ideas, suggestions and feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tested automatically (Jest, Selenium, unit, integration and acceptance tests) and manually.
            </p>
            <p>
                Made new developers productive and helped them with doing right things for company, team and themselves.
                Reviewed PRs, provided
                help and suggestions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wrote deployment procedures, k8s configurations (including automatic load balancing), configured GCP.
                Monitored application
                up-time and performance, detected and fixed application and infrastructure problems.
            </p>


            <h4>2012 - 2016, Senior Application Developer, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA</h4>

            <p>Focused on most painful problems and problems that no one else was well equipped to work on.</p>

            <p>Worked on building a professional software development team, set up organization processes, established
                shared
                vision, created and maintained standard operating procedures (SOP), and supervised other developers.</p>

            <p>
                Talked to customers, understood their problems, proposed and discussed solutions. Wrote specs, created
                UI wireframes, and
                project estimates. Generally, made things go forward.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wrote DDD-ish back-ends (domain model, repos, services, aggregate roots, domain events) in C#, LINQ for
                SQL, SQL, EF going
                against SQL Server and Oracle. All components wired together using IoC container (Windsor). From no
                coverage
                to full coverage by fast (unit) and slow (integration) tests.
            </p>

            <h4>1995 - 2012, Head of Engineering, MetaCommunications Inc., Iowa City, IA</h4>

            <p>Whatever was necessary. Did a lot of stuff including product design and implementation (C++, C#, SQL, a
                lot
                of JavaScript), product implementation on customer sites, marketing, testing (automated and manual),
                office
                and personnel management.</p>
