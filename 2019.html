        </p>
        <p>
            As a team member/team lead I value shared vision, aligned goals, care and empathy towards mission, results and people.

            <h4>October 2018 - Present, Principal Software Engineer, IDx Technologies, Coralville, IA</h4>
            <p>Participates in development of non-device software cloud software and yet unreleased device projects.</p>

            <h4>2016 - August 2018, Senior Engineer, Pear Deck, Iowa City, IA</h4>

            <p>
                We developed a web tool to help teachers engage students, especially in the challenging environments with large class sizes
                so everybody could be heard and be safe. We consistently pushed out new features while keeping system up
                and running and bringing in new developers. Our team did the full cycle of product development - from UX
                design to implementation to ongoing support.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            We were able to do that by working in small vertical teams, constantly aligning, and having a shared vision on what product,
            code and process should be. We never left anybody alone with problem, situation or task. As one of two most-experienced
            devs, I put steady efforts into gradually improving product architecture, code quality, system maintainabilty,
            and most importantly creating a shared vision on where we are going technically as a development team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implemented collection of microservices running on GKE/AppEngine using JavaScript, Node, Java, Python. Implemented front-ends
            in Javascript, Angular, Elm, Reason ML+React.
        </p>
        <p>
            Provided product/UX design ideas, suggestions and feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tested automatically (Jest, Selenium, unit, integration and acceptance tests) and manually.
        </p>
        <p>
            Made new developers productive and helped them with doing right things for company, team and themselves. Reviewed PRs, provided
            help and suggestions.
        </p>

        <!-- TODO: Technologies -->
        <p>
            Wrote deployment procedures, k8s configurations (including automatic load balancing), configured GCP. Monitored application
            up-time and performance, detected and fixed application and infrastructure problems.
        </p>

            <p>Worked on university wide procurement and travel expense management system used by Univesity Of Iowa and University
                of Northern Iowa.</p>

            <p>Focused on most painful problems and problems that no one else was well equipped to work on.</p>

            <p>Worked on building a professional software development team, set up organization processes, established shared
                vision, created and maintained standard operating procedures (SOP), and supervised other developers.</p>

                Talked to customers, understood their problems, proposed and discussed solutions. Wrote specs, created UI wireframes, and
                project estimates. Generally, made things go forward.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wrote front-ends in Angular, Knockout, jQuery, Telerik web controls using Bootstrap, AngularStrap (the mess of technologies
                is the result of having to support many systems, including very old ones).
            </p>

            <p>
                Wrote DDD-ish back-ends (domain model, repos, services, aggregate roots, domain events) in C#, LINQ for SQL, SQL, EF going
                against SQL Server and Oracle. All components wired together using IoC container (Windsor). From no coverage
                to full coverage by fast (unit) and slow (integration) tests.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wrote installation (Desired State Configuration) and deployment (we had our own Octopus-like deployment service) scripts,
                created a configuration management DSL that was used to describe queryable infrastructure model. Automated
                existing processes, created utilities for Active Directory, Confluence, TeamCity, Sql Server and Oracle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Implemented shared library of components to codify best practices (for front-end as well as for back-end). Made efforts to
                introduce policies regarding code sharing and continuous integration/deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Persisted in establishing team protocols (e.g. "Ask for help", "Check in", "Double-check", "Shared vision").
            </p>

                Wrote SSRS reports, wrote a rdl report formatter that allowed to define SSRS object styles using selectors and definitions
                (stylesheets for RDL), and made data analysis tools using F#.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wrote acceptance tests using home-grown WebDriver based framework that allowed separation of logical and physical concepts.
                Wrote test plans for manual testing and did that testing myself.
            </p>

            <p>
                Made presentations and organized seminars to teach colleagues about modern tools and methods. Set up student and staff code
                reviews and actively provided feedback and challenges for students working for the department.
            </p>

            <p>
