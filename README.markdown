####Product Design

####Implementation

All aspects of implementation - designed layered API's, database schemas, implemented features (front-end and back-end) using TDD/BDD, wrote reports and database upgrade scripts. Implemented necessary read path SQL queries, write path SQL batch operations and optimized them (or database schema) for better performance. 

#####Front-Ends

Developed Ajax and plain front-ends using such JavaScript libraries as jQuery, Knockout.js and underscore.js, testing critical or complicated user interactions using Jasmine.

#####Back-Ends:

Designed complex database schemas, wrote domain models, services, repositories (before LINQ days) using C#, .NET 3.5+, TDD/BDD (NUnit). Hand-wrote SQL (queries, views, stored procedures) for performance critical pieces. Implemented web services using WCF. 

Occasionally utilized UML and ER diagrams to communicate ideas to team members and other project stakeholders.
